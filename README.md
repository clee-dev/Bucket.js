# Bucket.js
*Bucket.js* is #xkcd's [Bucket](https://github.com/zigdon/xkcd-Bucket), but written in Javascript as a Discord bot and with some new features to boot. It uses [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) as its backing database, and is intended to be deployed to Google Cloud Platform but it can run anywhere as long as there's a Firestore key .json file for it to use.

I don't actually know perl, so feel free to help me decipher [the original source](https://github.com/zigdon/xkcd-Bucket/blob/master/bucket.pl) to implement the [list of features](http://wiki.xkcd.com/irc/Bucket).

*Bucket.js* is GPLv3. Since I used zigdon's source code for reference, even though it's not a port, this could be considered a 'derivative'.

I still need to write more things here like how to configure secrets.json & config.json, install, & run.
